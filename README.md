# Overview
A compilation of all my gigachad config files for the software I use in my linux enviorment.
In addition, a series of .sh files are located in the repo. When runned, this .sh files install
all the dependencies necessary to work perfectly. For more info, take a look at the 
[quick setup](#Quick-setup) section.
Either way, clone this repository to your home directory. This repo will be needed to get the
configuration files, so if you don't want the dot files, theres no need to clone it.

# Quick setup
There are multiple sh files to automate some installation processes.\n
- To get a full desktop installation run the following file: 
- Modular sh files are located in the sh_files directory

# Network config
To initially connect to the wireless network, I recomend using the 
[iwctl](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd) command.
1. Run the following command to start the interactive prompt
    ```
    iwctl
    ```
2. Get the wireless device name
    ```
    device list
    ```
3. If the device is turned of, do the following:
    ```
    device name set-property Powered on
    ```
    ```
    adapter adapter set-property Powered on
    ```
4. Scan for networks
    ```
    station <device_name> scan
    ```
5. Print the founded networks
    ```
    station <device_name> get-networks
    ```
6. Connect to the desired network
    ```
    station <device_name> connect <SSID>

    ```
7. You will be asked to input your the network password


Another good option is using the 
[network manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager) utility.
1. Run the following command to display the available networks
    ```
    nmcli device wifi list
    ```
2. Connect to the target network
    ```
    nmcli device wifi connect <SSID_or_BSSID> password <password>
    ```

You can test your connection with the following command:
    ```
    ping google.com
    ```

    ```
4. Make git rebase pulls automatically
